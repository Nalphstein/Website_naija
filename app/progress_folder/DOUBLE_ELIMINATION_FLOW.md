# 🏆 Enhanced Double Elimination System - Team Progression Flow

## 📋 **How Your 5-Team Playoff Works**

### **Initial Setup (5 Teams Example):**
```
Regular Season Standings:
1st: Team Alpha (24 pts) 
2nd: Team Beta (21 pts)  
3rd: Team Gamma (18 pts)
4th: Team Delta (15 pts)
5th: Team Echo (12 pts)
```

### **🔄 Automatic Bracket Assignment:**
- **Upper Bracket:** Teams 1-4 (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta)
- **Lower Bracket:** Team 5 (Echo) starts here

---

## 🎮 **Match Flow & Automatic Progression**

### **📍 Round 1 - Upper Bracket**
```
Upper Round 1:
├── Match 1: Alpha (1st) vs Delta (4th)
└── Match 2: Beta (2nd) vs Gamma (3rd)

Lower Round 1:
└── Echo (5th) gets BYE → Advances automatically
```

**What Happens When Matches Complete:**
- ✅ **Winners:** Advance to Upper Round 2
- ❌ **Losers:** Automatically drop to Lower Bracket Round 2

### **📍 Round 2 - Bracket Integration**
```
Upper Round 2:
└── Winner of Alpha vs Delta  VS  Winner of Beta vs Gamma

Lower Round 2: 
└── Echo (from bye)  VS  First loser from Upper Round 1
```

**Example Scenario:**
- Alpha beats Delta → Alpha advances
- Beta beats Gamma → Beta advances  
- **Result:** Delta and Gamma drop to Lower Bracket

### **📍 Round 3 - Lower Bracket Progression**
```
Lower Round 3:
└── Winner of (Echo vs Delta)  VS  Gamma
```

**Automatic Logic:**
- First upper bracket loser faces the 5th team
- Second upper bracket loser waits for next round
- Winners advance, losers are **eliminated**

### **📍 Finals Structure**
```
Upper Finals:
└── Alpha vs Beta (example winners)

Lower Finals:
└── Winner of Lower Bracket vs Loser of Upper Finals

Grand Finals:
└── Upper Bracket Champion vs Lower Bracket Champion
```
