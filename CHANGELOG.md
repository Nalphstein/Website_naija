## [v2.1.4] - 2025-01-19

### üîÑ **CRITICAL: Playoff Bracket Persistence Issue - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Playoff brackets were being saved to Firebase successfully but not persisting on page reload - they would disappear and not stay visible until manually reset.

**Root Cause**: Tournament loading logic was only checking for regular tournament data (ID: 'current') but playoff tournaments are saved with a different document ID ('playoffs'). The system wasn't checking for playoff tournament data during page initialization.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Enhanced TournamentSection Loading**: Modified `useEffect` to check for both playoff ('playoffs') and regular ('current') tournament data
- **Priority Loading System**: Playoff tournaments take priority over regular tournaments during page load
- **BracketPage Integration**: Added dedicated `useEffect` to restore playoff tournaments when switching to playoffs tab
- **Dual-Check System**: Both components now check for saved playoff data independently

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Pages/TournamentSection.tsx` - Enhanced tournament loading with playoff priority
- `app/components/pages/Tournament/BracketPage.tsx` - Added playoff-specific loading logic

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Before: Only checked for regular tournament
const savedTournament = await getTournament('current');

// After: Checks for playoff tournament first, then regular
try {
  const playoffTournament = await getTournament('playoffs');
  if (playoffTournament) setTournament(playoffTournament);
} catch {
  const regularTournament = await getTournament('current');
  if (regularTournament) setTournament(regularTournament);
}
```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ **Playoff brackets now persist** correctly across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ **Tournament state restoration** works seamlessly 
- ‚úÖ **No data loss** when navigating away and returning
- ‚úÖ **Proper loading priority** ensures playoff tournaments are restored first
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced user experience** with automatic restoration notifications

**User Experience**:
- Playoff brackets now remain visible after page reload
- Success toast notification when playoff bracket is restored
- Seamless transition between regular and playoff tournament modes
- No need to regenerate brackets after browser refresh

## [v2.1.3] - 2025-01-19

### üö® **CRITICAL: Firebase Undefined Values Bug - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Firebase was rejecting tournament data with `FirebaseError: Function setDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined`

**Root Cause**: Tournament objects contained `undefined` values in nested structures (team objects, bracket arrays, match properties) which Firebase Firestore explicitly rejects.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- **Enhanced Data Cleaning**: Added recursive `cleanObjectRecursively()` and `cleanArrayRecursively()` functions that traverse entire data structures
- **Validation System**: Created `detectUndefinedValues()` to identify exact paths where undefined values exist
- **Preprocessing**: All tournament data is now cleaned before any Firebase operations
- **Verification**: Added validation checks that detect and log undefined values with precise location paths

**Files Modified**:
- `app/services/tournamentService.ts` - Enhanced with recursive cleaning and validation
- `app/components/pages/Tournament/BracketPage.tsx` - Added undefined cleaning to local save function
- `app/Pages/TournamentSection.tsx` - Added data filtering before tournament updates

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Before: Data contained undefined values
{
  team1: { name: "Team A", score: undefined },  // ‚ùå Firebase rejects
  upperBracket: [undefined, match1, match2]      // ‚ùå Firebase rejects
}

// After: All undefined values cleaned/removed
{
  team1: { name: "Team A" },                     // ‚úÖ Firebase accepts
  upperBracket: [match1, match2]                 // ‚úÖ Firebase accepts
}
```

**Impact**: 
- ‚úÖ Playoff brackets now save successfully to Firebase
- ‚úÖ No more "invalid data" errors during tournament operations
- ‚úÖ Tournament state persists correctly across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ All bracket advancement now works without Firebase rejections

## [v2.1.2] - 2025-01-05

### üèÜ **Lower Bracket Ranking Progression - FIXED**

**Proper Elimination Order Based on Regular Season Rankings - RESOLVED ‚úÖ**
- **Issue**: Lower bracket didn't follow proper ranking-based progression order
- **Problem**: Higher-ranked teams were facing 5th place before lower-ranked teams
- **User Requirement**: 
  - **4th place** and **3rd place** sent to lower bracket ‚Üí **4th faces 5th first**, then **3rd faces winner**
  - **3rd place** and **2nd place** sent to lower bracket ‚Üí **3rd faces 5th first**, then **2nd faces winner**
  - **2nd place** and **1st place** sent to lower bracket ‚Üí **2nd faces 5th first**, then **1st faces winner**
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Enhanced `moveLoserToLowerBracket()` with proper ranking progression
  - **Lower-ranked teams** (higher ranking numbers) face 5th place immediately
  - **Higher-ranked teams** (lower ranking numbers) wait for next round
  - Progressive elimination order: worst rank ‚Üí 5th place, then next worst ‚Üí winner, etc.
- **Technical Details**:
  - Added comprehensive ranking analysis and sorting
  - Enhanced debugging to track elimination order
  - Maintained proper tournament integrity throughout progression
- **Impact**: Lower bracket now follows professional tournament elimination rules
